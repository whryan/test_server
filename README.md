# Test_server
A super lazy .sh script which starts a server using node's http-server in the directory, and opens it in google chrome.

To use it you need http-server installed (`npm install http-server`) if you have Node Package Manager and, on windows, something like Git Bash. Then, just drop it into wherever you want the server to be started.
