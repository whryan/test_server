# Test_server
A super lazy .sh script which starts a server using node's http-server in the directory, and opens it in google chrome. I put this here just so I can easily add it to new projects. Eventually I should probably make this more useful. 

To use it you need http-server installed (`npm install http-server`) if you have Node Package Manager and, on windows, something like Git Bash. Then, just drop it into wherever you want the server to be started, and run it to make the server and open it.
